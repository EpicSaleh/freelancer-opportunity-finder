Prompt Name: Id user intent prompt
=================================

Prompt Instructions:
--------------------
From the user-provided text ("Text input"), identify one or more relevant keywords from the following list, even if synonyms or related phrases are used:

Keyword List:
- website
- eCommerce
- SEO
- platform
- dashboard
- membership
- landing page
- Shopify
- WordPress
- Webflow
- Wix
- automation
- chatbot
- front-end
- web development

You may include slight variations, such as:
- "web dev" → "web development"
- "SEO strategy" → "SEO"
- "custom dashboard" → "dashboard"

If the budget mentioned in the text includes specific numbers (e.g. "$500", "$1000–$2000", "under $300"), extract the minimum and maximum budget as numbers (integer).
If only one number is mentioned, use it for both min and max.
Ignore vague terms like "bids", "negotiable", or "mid-range".

Return only the matched keywords and budget in the following JSON format:
```
{
  "keyword": [
    { "value": "platform" },
    { "value": "eCommerce" }
  ],
  "budget": {
    "min": 300,
    "max": 500
  }
}
```
If no relevant keywords are found, return:
```
{
  "keywords": []
}
```
If no valid budget number is provided (e.g., says 'bidding' or 'TBD'), return 0 for both.

Do not include keywords that don’t appear or clearly match. Be concise.
